# Exercise 7

In this exercise, you will learn how to use an IDE integration for Docker.

## Using an IDE integration

You can decide to use Eclipse or IntelliJ for this exercise. Pick the tool you are most comfortable with.

1. Install the IDE plugin for Docker for either [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-docker-tooling) or [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7724-docker-integration).
2. Point the Docker integration to the previously generated `Dockerfile` and generate an image from it from the IDE. Find the generated image in overview panel.
3. Start a container for this image from the IDE. Attach a console to it from the IDE and find the running Java process.
4. Push the image to Docker Hub from the IDE.
