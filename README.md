# Docker for JVM projects

Want to use Docker with your Java Virtual Machine (JVM) projects but don’t know where to start? You’ve come to the right place.

Join expert Benjamin Muschko to learn how Docker can help you deliver reliable, containerized software as part of your automation process. You’ll containerize, distribute, and test a Java application with Docker and explore the tooling integration for Docker, including IDEs, build tools, and CI, to make you even more productive. You’ll leave with a firm understanding of the role Docker plays in the development lifecycle and prepared to immediately use Docker in your own JVM projects.

## Prerequisites

All exercises are based on a sample Java project. Please make sure to follow the [instructions](./prerequisites/instructions.md) for setting up the sample project before joining the training.

## Exercises

All exercises are numbered and live in dedicated directories starting with the name `exercise-`. You'll find instructions for each exercise in each folder. Solutions are available in the `solution` folder. Try to solve each exercise yourself before having a look at the solution.
